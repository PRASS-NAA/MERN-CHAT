create two folders frontend and backend

in frontnend folder u create your react project

in backend folder dont initiate npm

npm init on root folder itslef 




put confidential things like port number on a separate file in root folder called .env 
use dotenv module to acces the enevi variable using .config()

IMPORTANT
it would make server,js vvv big if we put all the routes in it with the function handling the route (req,res)

so we will create routes folder to have sub routes

we will have another folder called controller for hadnling the routes

ONR JS FILE CAN HAVE ONLY ONE DEFAULT EXPORT, SO WHILE IMPORTING IT ONE OTHER JS FILE...U CAN NAME IT ANYTHING
